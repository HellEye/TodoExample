# Todo Application

This is a simple todo application, with backend in python and frontend in react
For more information check the respective directories

# Running

`docker-compose up` should prepare everything

then go to localhost:3000 to view the application

or localhost:8000/docs to view the autogenerated documentation

Docker compose was made without volumes due to issues with both backend (prisma client for python is reliant on the environment) and frontend (running as root from the container makes some files inaccessible later)

This could be fixed with more troubleshooting, but I feel like just copying the files works well enough, and for fast refresh while coding you can run just the DB from a container, and run servers manually

## Database

PostgreSQL
